# Web Development in Kotlin compared to classical approaches

This repo demonstrate the Web development with Kotlin.
To show how this works, classical approaches are also implemented
and therefore can be compared to the implementation in Kotlin.

What is covered:
* Static site generation: Plain HTML is compared to HTML written in 
  Kotlin and rendered to a file
*  Dynamic site generation: The site (or parts) is re-created for each request
   * Server side generation: Spring MVC with Thymeleaf is compared to 
     plain Kotlin HTML
   * Client side generation: Site generation with plain JavaScript is 
     compared to generating the HTML with Kotlin JS
